Prior to that, he was Principal Investigator for a research-oriented consultancy firm (1987-1991) and then member of research staff at the European Space Agency Research and Technology Centre, NL (1991-2001). He specializes in high-integrity real-time systems, edge-to-cloud continuum, software engineering, active learning, and informatics education. He has promoted and run a score of research collaborations around those themes, on national and international funding. He is a long-standing member of IEEE and ACM. He is the technical expert for Italy in ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22: WG 9 (Ada), of which he has been appointed convenor in September 2025, and WG 23 (Programming Language Vulnerabilities). Over 2004-2024, he has been the chairperson of Ada-Europe. After that, he was one of the founders of the Ada User Society, of which he currently is the chairperson. Since 2017, he has been a member of the HiPEAC Vision Editorial Team. He has been and continues to be member of the program committees of numerous reputed international conferences. He is associate editor for the Real-Time Systems journal, published by Springer Nature, and he continually reviews for numerous scientific journals in high standing."

    email='tucker.taft@gmail.com'
    description="S. Tucker Taft is Director of Language Research at AdaCore. His specialties include programming language design, advanced static analysis tools, formal methods, real-time systems, parallel programming, and model-based development. Tucker was a lead designer of the Ada 95 programming language, and is a member of the ISO Rapporteur Group that developed Ada 2005, Ada 2012, and Ada 2022. Tucker designed and implemented a parallel programming language called ParaSail, and helped define parallel programming extensions for Ada as part of the Ada 2022 standard.​ Prior to joining AdaCore, Tucker was Founder and CTO of SofCheck, Inc., providing tools and technology to enhance software development quality and productivity.  Prior to that Mr. Taft was a Chief Scientist at Intermetrics, Inc. and its follow-ons for 22 years.  Tucker received an A.B. Summa Cum Laude degree from Harvard University, where he also taught courses in compiler construction and programming language design."

    title="Ahlan Marriott, CH, Treasurer"
    email='Treasurer@ada-user.org'
    description="Ahlan Marriott is a naturalized Swiss citizen, born and educated in England. After graduating in the then novel subject of “Computer Science” he worked in the UK for ICL writing microcode for their 2900 series of computers. After a mere two years he emigrated to Geneva, Switzerland where he had previously been a student at CERN. In Geneva he worked for two years for the ill-fated Digital Equipment Corporation, after which he moved to Zürich to work in the defense industry at Contraves, where he first experienced the programming language Ada and the truly amazing Rational R1000. After five years he left Contraves to work for Soudronic with their embedded microcomputer-controlled welding machines. Twelve years later, together with a work colleague, he created his own company, White Elephant GmbH, to specialize in embedded microcomputer hard real-time kernels written in Ada, Modula-2, or a mixture of the two. Ahlan has been president of Ada-Switzerland since 2008, Treasurer of Ada-Europe since 2006 and is a founding member and Treasurer of the Ada User Society."

    title="Jerome Hugues, FR, Secretary"
    email='Secretary@ada-user.org'
    description="Jerome Hugues is a Principal Researcher at the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (CMU SEI) on the Assuring Cyber-Physical Systems team. His research interests focus on the design of software-based real-time and embedded systems and model-based engineering approaches. He is a Principal Investigator on projects at the intersection of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and cyber-physical systems (CPS). His research interests revolve around automation to deliver CPS faster with confidence. This includes combining model-based techniques and DevOps automation capabilities (“TwinOps” project), using the semantics of modeling language to deliver formal guarantees of a model properties (“SAFIR” project), and, more recently, rigorously defining MBSE processes. Jerome holds a Habilitation (2017) from INP Toulouse, a PhD (2005) and an engineering degree (2002) both from Telecom ParisTech, and an MS in computer science from UPMC (2002). Jerome is a member of the SAE AS-2C committee working on the AADL since 2005. Before joining the CMU SEI, he was full professor at the Department of Engineering of Complex Systems of ISAE-Supaero in Toulouse France, where he taught curriculum on systems engineering, safety-critical systems, and real-time systems. He contributes to the OSATE, Ocarina, and TASTE AADL open source toolchains."
